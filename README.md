# Introduction

This repository is a diary of my progress during the [100 Days of ML Code Challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuQMBj1cWPo). The challenge involves either doing data science related coding or learning 1 hour each day. I plan two work on two major projects over the next 100 days as described below.

I began this challenge on July 7, 2018 and it is currently [in progress](https://github.com/hammadshaikhha/100_Days_of_ML_Code_Challenge/blob/master/ProgressLog.md). 

# Project: Data Science from Scratch
This project involves coding the common data science tools and ML algorithms without using the popular libraries such as scikit-learn and tensorflow. I will write detailed notebooks that will go over both the mathematics and implementation for the algorithm of interest. These notebooks will be posted on my [other repository](https://github.com/hammadshaikhha/Math-of-Machine-Learning-Course-by-Siraj) and their links will be included in the progress log [here](https://github.com/hammadshaikhha/100_Days_of_ML_Code_Challenge/blob/master/ProgressLog.md).
