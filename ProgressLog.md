# 100 Days of ML Code Challenge - Log

## Day 1: July 7, 2018

1. I learned about non-parametric regression using the following resources:
   * [Chris McCormik Blog](http://mccormickml.com/2014/02/26/kernel-regression/)
   * [Andrew Ng Notes](http://cs229.stanford.edu/notes/cs229-notes1.pdf)
   * [Anders Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncF7ArjJFqM)
  
2. I summarized my readings into a consise note. 
   * Link to repository with note: [Nonparametric Regression](https://github.com/hammadshaikhha/Math-of-Machine-Learning-Course-by-Siraj/tree/master/Nonparametric%20Regression)
   
3. Next step is to code non-parametric regression from scratch. 


## Day 2: July 8, 2018

1. Start the nonparametric regression notebook
   * Generate nonlinear data
   * Estimate polynomial regression

2. The primary coding for notebook is complete, but there are next steps:
   * I need to add text explaining nonparametric regression
   * Need to comment the code
