# 100 Days of ML Code Challenge - Log

## Day 1: July 7, 2018

1. I learned about non-parametric regression using the following resources:
   * [Chris McCormik Blog](http://mccormickml.com/2014/02/26/kernel-regression/)
   * [Andrew Ng Notes](http://cs229.stanford.edu/notes/cs229-notes1.pdf)
  
2. I summarized my readings into a consise note. 
   * Link to repository with note: [Nonparametric Regression](https://github.com/hammadshaikhha/Math-of-Machine-Learning-Course-by-Siraj/tree/master/Nonparametric%20Regression)
   
3. Next step is to code non-parametric regression from scratch. 


## Day 2: July 8, 2018

1. Setup a notebook describing non-parametric regression.

2. Code the gaussian kernel regression
